# What is this project about?
This project is a video game that initially had inspirations drawn from real-time strategy games like the Warcraft franchise, Starcraft franchise and more. It has since evolved into a game with more resource management elements and a more relaxed atmosphere.

It was originally intended to be a completely realistic representation of Mars with accurate weather based off of NASA's InSight API, however this has changed as NASA's InSight lander was decomissioned in late December of 2022, consequently the API has no longer provides useful data.
